# COMP4037 Coursework 2: Multivariate Data Visualization

This project presents a multivariate visualization analysis of environmental impacts across various diet and demographic groups, using interactive radar charts and treemaps.

---

## üìä Visual Design Types

- **Radar Chart**: Comparing multiple environmental indicators across gender, age group, and diet type.
- **Treemap**: Showing variability (standard deviation) in environmental impact indicators, with a hierarchical structure.

---

## üõ† Tool Used

- Python with Plotly (interactive HTML exports)

---

## üß™ Variables & Dimensions

- **Diet Groups**: Meat, Meat50, Meat100, Fish, Vegan, Veggie
- **Demographics**: Gender (Male/Female), Age Group (20‚Äì79)
- **Environmental Indicators**: GHG Emissions, CH4, N2O, Land Use, Water Use, Water Scarcity, Eutrophication, Acidification, Biodiversity

## üß≠ Visual Mappings

| Visual | Size | Color | Hierarchy |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| Treemap | Number of participants | Standard deviation (SD) | Gender ‚Üí Age ‚Üí Diet |
| Radar | Environmental indicator score | Gender color | Subplots by diet |

---

## üìå Unique Observation

> **Meat100** diet group consistently exhibits the **highest variability** across environmental indicators, especially in CH‚ÇÑ, Land, and Water Scarcity ‚Äî suggesting potential presence of outliers or inconsistency within this group.
